\chapter{Selected Stream Cipher Algorithms}
\section{Vernam Cipher}
The Vernam cipher is a symmetric key cipher where each character in the plaintext is combined with a corresponding character from a random key, producing ciphertext. This cipher is proven to be unbreakable when the key is truly random, used only once, and at least as long as the plaintext...
